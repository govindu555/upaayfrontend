# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.


# Tools/Libraries Used:
 HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Hooks, Axios, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Boostrap Icons, Postman, Git, GitHub, VScode


# Improvements with More Time:
 I had to spend more time to DATA , API and Styles Because this is very important ports of project.
 I had more time to connected from frontend to backend using API Because this is first main important port of project Because Entire data is stored in mongoDB so I had to spend more time. 
 I had more time to add the css styles to project because Beauty is one of the port of any project Because any users are looking beauty of project 
 so I had to spend more time.

  # Challenges Faced and Solutions:
    I faced some problems at data, there is not sharing data from backend to frontend and from frontend to backend, postman is very helped to this. If API is not worked then postman is identified the API Error. postman is best API testing tool.
   console.log() method is one of the useful method and one of the best testing method in JavaScript Because Evenif any defficult times , 
   console.log() method is helped. when I faced some problems with data error then console.log() is very easily identifined the error. 
   I am using console.log() most of times to identify the data in poject.
